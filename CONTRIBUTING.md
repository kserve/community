# Contributing to KServe

So, you want to hack on KServe? Yay!

The following sections outline the process all changes to the KServe
repositories go through.  All changes, regardless of whether they are from
newcomers to the community or from the core team follow the
same process and are given the same level of review.

- [Working groups](#working-groups)
- [Code of conduct](#code-of-conduct)
- [Design documents](#design-documents)
- [Contributing a feature](#contributing-a-feature)
- [Setting up to contribute to KServe](#setting-up-to-contribute-to-kserve)
- [Pull requests](#pull-requests)
- [Issues](#issues)
- [Promote your company on kserve.io](#promote-your-company-on-kserveio)
- [Becoming a committer](#becoming-a-committer)


## Working groups

Any feature contribution to KServe should be started by first engaging with the
KServe working group.

## Code of conduct

All members of the KServe community must abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Design documents

Any substantial design deserves a design document. Design documents are written
with Google Docs and should be shared with the community by adding the doc to
our shared Drive and sending a note to the working group to let people know the
doc is there.

When documenting a new design, we recommend a 2-step approach:

1. Use the short-form [RFC template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcBeLfZ_JMGpVrPJmYtEIVH_9Y4U3AEKQdq_IKuOMrU) to outline your ideas and get early feedback.

2. Once you have received sufficient feedback and consensus, you may use the longer-form [design doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mtoui_PP2a9N59NjYHnsvrdJ8t2iKFwIJAx1zRO_I1c) to specify and discuss your design in more detail.

To use either template, open the template and select "Use Template" in order to
bootstrap your document.

## Contributing a feature

In order to contribute a feature to KServe you'll need to go through the
following steps:

- Discuss your idea with the working group on Slack in a discussion thread.

- Once there is general agreement that the feature is useful, create a GitHub
  issue to track the discussion. The issue should include information about the
  requirements and use cases that it is trying to address. Include a discussion
  of the proposed design and technical details of the implementation in the issue.

- If the feature is substantial enough:

  - Working group leads will ask for a design document as outlined in the
    previous section. Create the design document and add a link to it in the
    GitHub issue. Don't forget to send a note to the working group to let
    everyone know your document is ready for review.

  - Depending on the breadth of the design and how contentious it is, the
    working group leads may decide the feature needs to be discussed in one
    or more working group meetings before being approved.

  - Once the major technical issues are resolved and agreed upon, post a
    note to the working group's mailing list with the design decision and
    the general execution plan.

- Submit PRs to [kserve/kserve](https://github.com/kserve/kserve) with your
  code changes.

- Submit PRs to [kserve/website](https://github.com/kserve/website) with
  documentation for your feature, including usage examples when possible.
  See [here](https://github.com/kserve/website/blob/main/docs/help/contributor/mkdocs-contributor-guide.md) to learn how to write docs for kserve.io.

Note, that we prefer "bite-sized" PRs instead of "giant monster" PRs. It is
preferable if you can introduce large features in smaller reviewable changes
that build on top of one another.

If you would like to skip the process of submitting an issue and instead would
prefer to just submit a pull request with your desired code changes then that's
fine. But keep in mind that there is no guarantee of it being accepted and so
it is usually best to get agreement on the idea/design before time is spent
coding it. However, sometimes seeing the exact code change can help focus
discussions, so the choice is up to you.


## Setting up to contribute to KServe

Check out this [README](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/README.md)
to learn about the KServe source base and setting up your [development environment](https://kserve.github.io/website/master/developer/developer/).

## Pull requests

If you're working on an existing issue, simply respond to the issue and express
interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is
active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

To submit a proposed change:

- Fork the affected repository.

- Create a new branch for your changes.

- Develop the code/fix.

- Add new test cases. In the case of a bug fix, the tests should fail
  without your code changes. For new features try to cover as many
  variants as reasonably possible.

- For new features e2e tests should be added [here](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/tree/master/test/e2e)

- Modify the documentation as necessary.

- Verify the entire CI process (building and testing) works.

While there may be exceptions, the general rule is that all PRs should
be 100% complete - meaning they should include all test cases and documentation
changes related to the change.

Make sure to [sign off your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
before you submit your PR.

Take a look at the article on [Writing Good Pull Requests](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Writing-Good-Pull-Requests) for additional guidance.
And check out the article on [Reviewing Pull Requests](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Reviewing-Pull-Requests) to learn more about our PR
review process.

## Issues

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/issues/new/choose) can be used
to report bugs or submit feature requests.

When reporting a bug please include the following key pieces of information:

- The version of the project you were using (e.g. version number,
  or git commit)

- Setup environment you are using.

- The exact, minimal, steps needed to reproduce the issue.
  Submitting a 5 line script will get a much faster response from the team
  than one that's hundreds of lines long.

## Promote your company on kserve.io

If your company supports KServe or uses it in production, you can list it on our
[adopters page](https://kserve.github.io/website/master/community/adopters).
We have categories for *providers* (who offer hosted or managed KServe services
to their customers), *end users* (who use and consume KServe) and *integrations*
(commercial or open source products that work with KServe).

Please add your company logo, preferably in SVG format, to [here](https://github.com/kserve/website/tree/main/docs/images).

## Becoming a committer

A committer is a contributor who has gained the privilege to commit code to the
project. It also means being committed to the project and the community as a whole.
Contributors who aspire to become committers should already be doing most of the
activities that are expected to be done by the project's committers.

**Responsibilities of a committer:**

- Triage and respond to issues
- Possess expertise in certain areas and familiarity with the majority of the code base
- Review pull requests
- Answer questions on Slack
- Mentor new project contributors

Contributors who have demonstrated their proficiency to make substantial code
contributions and shown their commitment to the projects success over a
prolonged period of time are candidates to become committers.

**How new committers are chosen:**

The [KServe Technical Charter](./KSERVE-TECHICAL-CHARTER.md#2-technical-steering-committee)
outlines the process to become a KServe committer:

> - **iii**. A _Contributor_ may become a _Committer_ by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers. 

For this purpose, the technical steering committee (TSC) shall periodically
review the activity of project contributors and propose qualifying contributors
to be promoted to become committers.

To help find candidates for promotion, existing committers can use the
[`list-contributors.py`](scripts/python/list-contributors.py) script to review
recent contributor activity:

```shell
$ make list-pr-authors

Contributors to 'kserve/kserve' (PR authors) by number of PRs (>3) since 2023-03-02:

 39  supercoder      [5083, 5077, 5040, 5038, 5035, 5031, 5024, 5016, 5006, 5004, ... ]
 20  kservehacker    [5089, 5061, 5054, 5029, 5020, 5002, 5001, 4998, 4956, 4952, ... ]
  6  code4fun        [5069, 5048, 5027, 5026, 5008, 4867]


$ make list-pr-reviewers

Contributors to 'kserve/kserve' (PR commenters, reviewers) by number of PRs (>3) since 2023-03-02:

 13  reviewchamp     [5089, 5075, 5072, 5047, 5042, 5040, 5038, 5031, 4993, 4969, ... ]
  9  nitpickr        [5079, 5054, 5049, 5040, 4954, 4877, 4782, 4762, 4739]
  4  casualcodr      [5062, 5039, 5025, 4867]
```

This script should only be used to identify suitable candidates. The actual
candidate selection should take more factors into consideration than number of
commits or PRs reviewed.

**Areas of expertise:**

Another criterion to use when selecting new committers is the project area that requires
help with reviewing PRs and mentoring new contributors. Contributors that have
a lot of expertise in a particular area who have helped review PRs in that area
make good candidates to be promoted as committers. The various
projects under the KServe umbrella may have a different set of committers and
focus areas.

Some of those areas of expertise include:

- **KServe**:
  - Python SDK
  - Open inference protocol, data plane
  - Release & testing infra
  - Webapp
  - Website
- **ModelMesh**:
  - Controller
  - Runtime adapter
  - Storage adapter
  - Rest proxy
