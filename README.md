### Become a contributor
1. Familiar youself with the [KServe contribution guideline](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. The [KServe developer guideline](https://kserve.github.io/website/master/developer/developer), [doc contributor guideline](https://github.com/kserve/website/blob/main/docs/help/contributor/mkdocs-contributor-guide.md) is the starting point for contributors to make code or doc contributions.
3. To dig deeper, check out the [KServe user guide](https://kserve.github.io/website/master/modelserving/control_plane)
and read some [design docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#design-documents).
4. Participate in the KServe working group.

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on KServe, look for GitHub issues
marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Primary KServe repo](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+good+first+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/kserve/website/issues)

Of course, even if there's not an issue opened for it, you can always do more
testing throughout the platform. Similarly, you can always contribute more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post?
